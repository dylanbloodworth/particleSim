# particleSim

The repository currently contains two files. Each file runs the same behavior using twoi different methods: (1) Euler method and (2) Verlet Method.


Plans:
- Implement substeps to calculate positions multiple times during a frame
- Uncouple the drawing of the particles from the position calcuations (i.e. making some **renderer**?)
- Implement collisions between objects.
    1. Brute force implementation
    2. Smart grid implementation
